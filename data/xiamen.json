  "overview": "Xiamen, located on the southeast coast of China in Fujian Province, stands as one of the country's most livable and picturesque cities, earning its nickname 'Garden City' through abundant greenery, clean air, and careful urban planning. This port city of 5 million people faces Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait, a geographical position that has shaped its history as a trading hub and given it a cosmopolitan character rare in mainland China. Xiamen's unique charm lies in its successful preservation of natural beauty alongside modern development, creating an urban environment where residents and visitors can enjoy both contemporary amenities and traditional coastal tranquility. The crown jewel of Xiamen is undoubtedly Gulangyu Island, a car-free UNESCO World Heritage Site located just a five-minute ferry ride from the mainland. This pedestrian-only island of 2 square kilometers packs an extraordinary concentration of colonial-era architecture, with over 1,000 historical buildings representing various Western styles brought by foreign traders and missionaries who settled here in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The island's nickname 'Piano Island' reflects its unusual cultural heritage—despite its small size, Gulangyu produced an extraordinary number of classical musicians, and today it houses China's only piano museum. Wandering through its winding lanes, visitors discover hidden gardens, seaside villas, and cafes that evoke the atmosphere of a Mediterranean coastal town. On the mainland, Xiamen University regularly tops lists of China's most beautiful campuses, its traditional Fujian-style architecture set against hills and overlooking the sea. The nearby Nanputuo Temple, a thousand-year-old Buddhist monastery, attracts pilgrims and tourists with its striking architecture and vegetarian restaurant. Xiamen's cuisine reflects its coastal location, with fresh seafood dominating menus and local specialties like oyster omelets, satay noodles, and peanut soup delighting food lovers. The city's pleasant subtropical climate, with flowers blooming year-round, makes it an attractive destination in any season. Whether you're exploring colonial history on Gulangyu, enjoying fresh seafood by the waterfront, or simply soaking in the relaxed atmosphere of this coastal gem, Xiamen offers a refreshing alternative to the intensity of China's larger cities.",
